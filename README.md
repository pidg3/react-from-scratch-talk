# React From Scratch Demo

This code is a 'fork' of https://ryanfunduk.com/articles/react-from-scratch/ (not a proper fork as I couldn't find the repo!)

To start:

- npm run build
- npm start

The code is used to demonstrate how a basic version of React can be built up from scratch - try checking out final-demo/components as a starting point.
